### And a Little Child Shall Lead Them - Boyd K Packer
The Challenge of Mortality
> The creation of life is a great responsibility for a married couple. **It is the challenge of mortality to be a worthy and responsible parent.** Neither man nor woman can bear children alone. It was meant that children have two parents—both a father and a mother. _No other pattern or process can replace this one_.

Life is not Fair or Easy
> No pain will last forever. It is not easy, but **life was never meant to be either easy or fair**.

We Learn More From Our Children Than From Our Parents
> One of the great discoveries of parenthood is that we learn far more about what really matters from our _children_ than we ever did from our parents.

The Ultimate End of Church Activity
> The ultimate end of all activity in the Church is to see a husband and his wife and their children happy at home, protected by the principles and laws of the gospel, sealed safely in the covenants of the everlasting priesthood. _Husbands and wives should understand that their first calling—from which they will never be released—is to one another and then to their children._

Family Time Should Be Protected and Respected
> There are many things about living the gospel of Jesus Christ that cannot be measured by that which is counted or charted in records of attendance. We busy ourselves with buildings and budgets and programs and procedures. In so doing, _it is possible to overlook the very spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ._
> 
> Too often someone comes to me and says, “President Packer, wouldn’t it be nice if … ?”
> 
> I usually stop them and say no, because I suspect that what follows will be a new activity or program that is going to add a burden of time and financial means on the family.
> 
> **_Family time is sacred time and should be protected and respected._** We urge our members to show devotion to their families.
