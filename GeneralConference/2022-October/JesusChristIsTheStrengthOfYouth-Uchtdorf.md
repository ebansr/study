### Put your trust in Jesus Christ. He will lead you the right way. He is your strength.

> In preparing for this message today, I have felt strong promptings to address the young women and young men.
> I am also speaking to those who used to be young, even to those who can’t really remember it anymore.
> And I speak to all who love our young people and want them to succeed in life.

Elder Uchtdorf's message is intended for all audiences because God's standards apply to all people and are a benefit to all who hear and obey.

> **For the rising generation, I have a message especially for you from our Savior, Jesus Christ.**

We should take this seriously and should ensure our children and youth receive this message. If the Savior has a message especially for you, then special attention should be paid to the message.

### The Savior’s Message to You

"I love you. Fear not. Doubt not. Be of good cheer. Let not your heart be troubled."

"Repent and leave your sins behind. Change your heart so I can forgive you."

"I took your sins upon myself so that you can repent. This is part of the plan of happiness Heavenly Father has given you."

"Your baptismal (sacrament) covenants bind us together so that together we can carry any burden. I will be your strength. There are no limits to what you can accomplish with my help. Your potential is limitless."

"The way I see you is different than how the world sees you. You are a son of the Almighty God, and He wants you to receive all that He has."

"This is why you are on earth today - to learn, grow, and progress and become everything your Father in Heaven has created you for. This is the purpose behind His great plan of happiness, His Church, His priesthood, the scriptures — **_all of it_**."

"That is your destiny. That is your future. That is **your choice**!"

### Truth and Choices

> At the heart of God’s plan for your happiness is your power to choose.
> Footnote - You might say the Father’s plan was designed to allow you to express your desires through your choices so that you can receive the full results of what you desire. As Elder Dale G. Renlund taught, “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him” (“Choose You This Day,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2018, 104).

> There’s a lot of confusion in the world about what is right and wrong. Truth gets twisted to make evil seem good and good seem evil.

This is ever-present in the world and society today. Many of the ideas and causes which are presented as good and right are contrary to God's commandments. It is sometimes difficult to stand against the ideas out of fear or being uncomfortable. It is also difficult to distinguish between loving your neighbor and accepting false doctrines or ideas.

> Somehow, here on earth, it seems more complicated than it ought to be. [...] But when you earnestly seek the truth—eternal, unchanging truth—your choices become much clearer.

> So where do you find truth?
> It is contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And the fulness of that gospel is taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

> When you have important choices to make, Jesus Christ and His restored gospel are the best choice. When you have questions, Jesus Christ and His restored gospel are the best answer. When you feel weak, Jesus Christ is your strength.

### For the Strength of Youth

> This new version of For the Strength of Youth is subtitled A Guide for Making Choices. Please embrace it as your own and share it with your friends.

> The best guide you can possibly have for making choices is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the strength of youth.
> So the purpose of For the Strength of Youth is to point you to Him.

> It’s also important to know what For the Strength of Youth does not do. It doesn’t make decisions for you. It doesn’t give you a “yes” or “no” about every choice you might ever face. For the Strength of Youth focuses on the foundation for your choices. It focuses on values, principles, and doctrine instead of every specific behavior.
> Is it wrong to have rules? Of course not. We all need them every day. But it is wrong to focus only on rules instead of focusing on the Savior. You need to know the whys and the hows and then consider the consequences of your choices. You need to put your trust in Jesus Christ. He will lead you the right way. He is your strength.

It focuses on the trunk and branches of the tree and not on the leaves. The leaves (rules) grow out from the turnk (doctrine) and the branches (principles). The rules will follow when youth understand and embrace the doctrine and principles.

> Footnote - In a way, this is what the Pharisees of Jesus’s day tried to do. In their zeal to stop people from breaking the law, they compiled hundreds of rules based on their understanding of sacred writings. What the Pharisees got wrong was that they thought their rules would save them. Then, when the Savior appeared, they did not recognize Him.

When the Savior returns, we all need to be able to recognize Him. Blindly teaching and following rules does not acquaint us with the Savior. Rules are not bad, but should be understood in context to the doctrine of Christ and the principles of the gospel.

> Footnote - Another reason a principle-based approach is needed today is the increasing cultural diversity of the Lord’s Church. Principles are eternal and universal. Specific rules or applications of those principles work well in some places but not in others. What unites us is Jesus Christ and the eternal truths He taught, even if specific applications vary over time and across cultures. So the problem with listing every possible do and don’t isn’t just that it’s impractical and unsustainable. The problem is that it diverts our focus from the true Source of our strength, our Savior, Jesus Christ.

### The Power of True Doctrine

> President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. … The world would shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature” (“Born of God,” Ensign, Nov. 1985, 6)

> President Russell M. Nelson taught: “When your greatest desire is to let God prevail [in your life], … many decisions become easier. … Many issues become nonissues! You know how best to groom yourself. You know what to watch and read, where to spend your time, and with whom to associate. You know what you want to accomplish. You know the kind of person you … want to become.”22
A Higher Standard

> Russell M. Nelson taught: “In my much younger years, I studied the work of others who had compiled lists of things to do and things not to do on the Sabbath. It wasn’t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a sign between me and my Heavenly Father. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don’ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, ‘What sign do I want to give to God?’ That question made my choices about the Sabbath day crystal clear” (“The Sabbath Is a Delight,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 130).

> Jesus Christ has very high standards for His followers. And the invitation to earnestly seek His will and live by His truths is the highest standard possible!

> Important temporal and spiritual choices should not only be based on personal preference or what is convenient or popular.

> The Lord is **not** saying, “Do whatever you want.” He is saying, “Let God prevail.” He is saying, “Come, follow me.” He is saying, “Live in a holier, higher, more mature way.” He is saying, “Keep my commandments.”

> My dear friends, let me repeat, if the Savior were standing here today, He would express His endless love for you, His complete confidence in you. He would tell you that you can do this. You can build a joyful, happy life because Jesus Christ is your strength. You can find confidence, peace, safety, happiness, and belonging now and eternally, because you will find all of it in Jesus Christ, in His gospel, and in His Church.
