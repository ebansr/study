## Russell M Nelson
- The Lord loves effort. The Lord loves consistency. The Lord loves steadfastness. ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYMRM81t7C6/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=8b87e295-4931-4591-998a-76c654d16ab3))

- The Lord loves effort, because effort brings rewards that can’t come without it. ([An Especially Noble Calling](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/14jones?lang=eng))

- Repentance is the Lord’s regimen for spiritual growth. [...] Repentance is conversion! A repentant soul is a converted soul, and a converted soul is a repentant soul. ([Repentance and Conversion](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/repentance-and-conversion?lang=eng))

## Boyd K Packer
- You have to learn to be alone in a crowd. You have to have such control. That is so important. We spend so much time in airports and in other noisy places. But I do not go there. I might be standing there physically, but I am not there spiritually, because I am thinking things and doing things in my mind. If you will learn to do that, then the Spirit will teach you. (Mine Errand from the Lord, 132).

- The doctrines of the gospel are revealed through the Spirit to prophets, not through the intellect to scholars. (Mine Errand from the Lord, 309).

- If all you know is what you see with your natural eyes and hear with your natural ears, then you will not know very much. (Mine Errand from the Lord, 339).

- We are floating along on a quiet stream and all is calm. But if you listen closely, you can hear the sound of rapids ahead. (Mine Errand from the Lord, 402).

## Brigham Young
- Every discovery in science and art, that is really true and useful to mankind has been given by direct revelation from God, though but few acknowledge it. It has been given with a view to prepare the way for the ultimate triumph of truth, and the redemption of the earth from the power of sin and Satan. We should take advantage of all these great discoveries, the accumulated wisdom of ages, and give to our children the benefit of every branch of useful knowledge, to prepare them to step forward and efficiently do their part in the great work. (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 18–19)

## Leo Tolstoy
- “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him. ([The Kingdom of God Is Within You](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/175977-the-most-difficult-subjects-can-be-explained-to-the-most))
